# Kicad Like A Pro - Project 2 - Raspberry Pi Full Stack HAT
This repository contains the PCB design project from the book and course "Kicad Lika a Pro"

In this project you will build on the knowledge and skill of the previous two project and design an Arduino-compatible board using, mostly, surface-mounted components. 

The board will contain a micro controller, two EEPROM modules, a clock and calendar module, two crystal oscillators, and several SMD-sized resistors, capacitors and LEDs. In addition, it will include headers for connecting peripherals to the micro controller.

All this, in a relatively small board, measuring 44x28 mm. Working on this board will give you the opportunity to explore some of Kicad’s powerful features, such as splitting schematic diagrams into more than one sheets, using an external autorouter, and converting a two-layer board into a four layer board.

The name I have given to this board is “Battery powered Arduino with clock and extended EEPROM”. Or, let’s call it “BACEE”, for short.
